An algorithm is a step by step instruction solution 
that if followed carefully, and sequentially, it will
solve a problem. Example: an algorithm to add 3 + 4 is

1. Define a variable and assign the value of three
            number_one = 3
2. Define another variable and assign the value of four
            number_two = 4
3. Add the two variables
            number_one + number_two = 3 + 4 = 7
4. print the solution
            print(number_one + number_two)
