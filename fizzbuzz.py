#Define a function called fizzbuzz
#This function will receive two variables or inputs
#Inside the fizzbuzz function, a conditional will be
#created to meet the conditions as follows:
# if a number is divisible by 5 and by 3, the function
#will print the string "fizzbuzz"
#if a number is only divisible by 3 (zero-remainder),
#the function will print "fizz"
#if a number is only divisible by 5, the function will
#print "buzz"
#else, print the number received.
#Then the function will be invoked so that it accomplish
#its main purpose: when given two inputs (numbers)
#the function will print the sequence of numbers in 
#between the two inputs as long as any of the if-conditions
#are not met, when a condition is met, the function
#will print the replacement output
